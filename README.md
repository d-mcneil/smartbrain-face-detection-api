Developed a full-stack web application with responsive design using **React**, **Node**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL** as part of Zero to Mastery Academy’s Complete Web Developer curriculum. Integrated Clarifai's API to detect faces in images, the user’s total score is increased, and their rank is displayed compared to all SmartBrain users

This project was created as part of the Zero to Mastery Complete Web Developer course. Additional functionality beyond what was done in the course includes deleting users, calculating and displaying rank out of all users, recognizing and incrementing user score for all detected faces in an image, and displaying error messages and user profile.
